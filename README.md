## Introduction
Violence detection is a critical application in modern surveillance systems, aiming to enhance safety and security in various environments. This project leverages the power of YOLOv8, a cutting-edge object detection model, to accurately identify violent behaviors in video footage.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluating this model is the [Real Life Violence Situations Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedmustafa/real-life-violence-situations-dataset). This dataset contains a variety of real-life violent and non-violent video clips, providing a comprehensive resource for training robust detection models.
